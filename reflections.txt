You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

I didn't go through this section of the course as i had prerequisite knowledge for completing this project.
Everything is going on smoothly, I didn't come across any challenge until now.
